# System Programming course

## This repo contains assignments for the Embedded Linux Programming course on Cousera. It's a wonderful course, unfortunately for me its also very time consuming. but im learning a lot so thats all that matters.

## Assignment 1
- write a shell script for `finder.sh` and `writer.sh`

## Assignment 2
- setup `AARCH64` developer toolchain
- create a Makefile to compile `writer.c`
- modify `finder-test.sh` to uncomment `make`
- use `syslog.h` to write to `/var/logs`

## Assignment 3 part 1
- write wrappers for execvp and fork
